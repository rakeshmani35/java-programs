A resource is an object that must be closed once your program is done using it. For example, a
File resource or JDBC resource for a database connection or a Socket connection resource.
Before Java 7, there was no auto resource management and we should explicitly close the
resource once our work is done with it. Usually, it was done in the finally block of a try-
catch statement. This approach used to cause memory leaks and performance hit when we
forgot to close the resource.
